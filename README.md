# enma.rs

A crate serving anime and manga information ðŸ“¦

> enma.rs is basically a rust port and a super set of the [aniwatch scraper package](https://github.com/ghoshRitesh12/aniwatch), which is internally used by the [aniwatch-api](https://github.com/ghoshRitesh12/aniwatch-api).
> <br/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> 1. This package is just an unofficial package for the different providers of anime and manga and is in no other way officially related to the same.
> 2. The content that this package provides is not mine, nor is it hosted by me. These belong to their respective owners. This package just demonstrates how to build a package that scrapes websites and uses their content.
